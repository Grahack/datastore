Core.typed is an optional, incremental typechecker for Clojure
developed by Ambrose BS.

 - [GitHub](https://github.com/clojure/core.typed)
 - [JIRA](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CTYP)

The `core.typed` artifact itself contains tests, the typechecker and
annotations for a number of libraries. It is quite likely that the
information you want is actually in
[`core.typed.rt`](/store/v1/org.clojure/core.typed.rt/).
