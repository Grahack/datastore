Sorted sets maintain their elements in sorted order, sorted by the function compare.
Use sorted-set-by to get a different element order.

Sorted sets are in most ways similar to unsorted sets.
Read the docs for sorted-map to learn how sorted _maps_ differ from unsorted maps.
All of those differences apply equally to how sorted sets differ from unsorted sets, if you replace 'key/value pairs' with 'elements', and sorting by keys with sorting by elements.
